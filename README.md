Repository for MECH3895 Individual Mechatronics and Robotics Project

## Project Description

A Level 3 Mechatronics and Robot Project for the University of Leeds. This project explores using a swarm of simulated robotic agents
to explore an unknown water pipe network. The project is done in Python and contains a number of different modules that are used to
simulate the environment and the agents. Further information can be found in the report and the documentation.

## Installation

Installations instructions can be found in the documentation.

To build the documentation, run the following command in the ~/docs directory:

```bash

make html

```

## Usage

To run a simulation, run the following command in the project root directory:

```bash

python3 main.py

```

This will begin a CLI that will step through creating and then running a simulation.
